- app lifecycles
    - difference between focus and visibility
    - focus
        # onResume
        # onPause
    - visibility
        # onStop
        # onRestart
    # onStart
        - is called everytime visibility is true
        - onRestart only happens after first onStart
    # onDestroy
        - happens when app is closed or when orientation is changed
- mutable state
    # by remember
        - used to remember stored objects in a composable
    # by rememberSaveable
        - used to remember stored objects that need to be retrieved again after onDestroy
    # mutableStateOf
        - state data type
    - add imports
        # import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
        # import androidx.compose.runtime.setValue
    ex. var result by remember { mutableStateOf( 1) }
- textfield
    # TextField(value = <>, onValueChange = {})
    # OutlinedTextField
        - Gives outline around textfield
    # it
        - use it as input for textfield
    # label
        ex. label = { Text( text = <text> ) }
    # singleLine
        - condenses text box to single horizontally scrollable line
        ex. singleLine = true
    # keyboardOptions
        # keyboardType = KeyboardType.<type>
            - set keyboard type
        ex. keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Number)
- viewmodel
    - add implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose:2.6.1") under dependencies in build.gradle.kts
    - used so that state is kept during onDestroy() instead of using by rememberSaveable state values
- alertdialog
    # AlertDialog()
    - produces alert box popup
    # onDismissRequest = {}
        - executes when user clocks outside of dialog box


# verticalArrangement = Arrangement.
# horzontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
# shape = RoundedCornerShape(<.dp>)
    - use as visual
# modifier.align(alignment = Alignment.)
# modifier.statusBarsPadding()
    - ?
# modifier.safeDrawingPadding()
    - >
# modifier.verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())
# modifier.wrapContentSize()
    - wraps content according to container
